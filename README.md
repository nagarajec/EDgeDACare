When the user starts the computer the program will start running on the background, if we can capture the outlook calendar from code that perfect if not then lets pop up asking to upload their calendar... then every 30mins/1hr we show the notification that Jeya had saying you have been on for this much time... during the free timeslot of their calendar we will pop up the meme, running gif, youtube video and stuff
